# Tardoc
Creates a Tardoc (Swiss Insurance Tariff) compliant physical exam documentation. Fully customizable through a csv file.

I cannot guarantee the completeness or actual Tardoc compliance of the program for legal reasons.
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY!

If you are a complete beginner:
- For the program to work you need to install python3. See a tutorial on how you do that.

- You can customize the organe.csv to your liking.
  
- However, beware: items "organ" and "kuerzel" need to stay the same. So e.g. Kreislauf and h
  
- If you want to add a bilateral finding to your status set the item to bilateral 1.

- Every item is active by default. If you want to silence it set "active" column to 0.
